# SafePlay Wallet Repository Overview

## Project Summary
SafePlay Wallet is a cross-chain smart wallet designed for families, focusing on secure usage for minors, parental controls, multi-chain payments, and consent-based data monetization. The system spans smart contracts, backend services, and a mobile application to deliver a cohesive experience.

## Top-Level Structure (planned)
- `/contracts`
  - `/starknet` — Cairo contracts for Starknet functionality
  - `/ethereum` — Solidity contracts for Ethereum interoperability
  - Other chain-specific contract directories as needed
- `/backend` — Node.js/Express services handling API, orchestration, and integrations
- `/mobile-app` — React Native application for end users (parents, minors, gamers)
- `/docs` — Architecture diagrams, specifications, and onboarding guides (to be added)

## Key Components (planned)
1. **Parental Control Smart Contracts**: Manage guardianship, spending limits, and transaction approvals.
2. **Cross-Chain Payment Services**: Integrations with Starknet, Ethereum, Bitcoin Lightning, and stablecoins for routing payments.
3. **Consent-Based Data Monetization**: Privacy-preserving data sharing mechanisms with auditing and reward distribution.
4. **Education & Safety Hub**: Content delivery modules for teaching safe crypto habits to minors.
5. **Mobile Application**: Mobile-first interface with biometric authentication, alerts, and simplified transaction flows.

## Initial Setup Notes
- Target stack includes Cairo, Solidity, Node.js (Express), React Native, and integrations with Lightning Network APIs.
- Ensure development environments for Cairo, Starknet CLI, Hardhat/Foundry, and React Native are configured before implementing components.
- Testing approach should cover smart contracts (unit, integration), backend APIs, and mobile UX flows.

## Next Steps
- Establish actual directory skeleton matching the planned structure.
- Document environment setup scripts and prerequisites.
- Define Day 1 deliverables: minimal contracts, backend API skeleton, and mobile app scaffolding.
